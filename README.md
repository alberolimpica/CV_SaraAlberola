# Sara's CV
This is a small project for one of the subjects of the Web development Master's Degree.

We were asked to develop our CV using HTML and SASS as a one page application. We also worked using Styleling in this project. As a base, we worked using a given boilerplate developed by the University (which can be found here: https://github.com/uoc-advanced-html-css/uoc-boilerplate).

The page was deployed in Netify and can be found here:
